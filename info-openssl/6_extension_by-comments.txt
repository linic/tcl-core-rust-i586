                ----------
                This extension contains:
                  libssl.so.3
                  libcrypto.so.3
                from openssl - Apache 2.0 - https://www.openssl.org/
                This is the minimum used by rust.
                Built by linic@hotmail.ca using the method described in these URLs: 
                  https://github.com/linic/tcl-core-rust-i586
                  https://github.com/linic/openssl-i586
                About versioning, each openssl-x.y.z-i586.tcz is the first version, but
                it lists in the Change-log all the previous versions that were built
                using the method described in the previous urls.
                There is also a openssl-i586.tcz which serves as the latest.
